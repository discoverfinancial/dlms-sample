# DLMS Sample Application

This repository contains a sample application for the [Document Lifecycle Management System (DLMS)](TODO:PUT-LINK-TO-MAIN-DLMS-REPO-HERE).

The use case assumed in this sample application is that of a team outing which needs to be planned and scheduled. However, the primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a template to aid you in creating your own custom DLMS-based application.

The best way to build your own DLMS-based application is to begin with this sample application and customize it for your use case.

The documentation for this repository is divided into three sections as follows:

* [How to build and run the sample application](./docs/GettingStarted.md)

* [Understanding how the sample application works](./docs/UnderstandingSampleApp.md)

* [Customizing the sample application for your use case](./docs/CustomizingSampleApp.md)
